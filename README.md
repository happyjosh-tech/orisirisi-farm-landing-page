# orisirisi-farm-landing-page
just going through my archive and discovered a html and css landing page i did previously when i was started coding. Unfortunately I wasn't introduced to github, decided to make it live via github today.

This project was written in HTML and CSS. It's an open source project so feel free to clone and modify it anyhow you wish but please give us some star.
